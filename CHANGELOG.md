### Changed

- Migrated from TravisCI to GitHub Actions for build, test, and packaging.

## [3.1.2] - 2019-02-21
### Fixed
- Username and password are no longer required to be set, making it possible to
  connect to endpoints that do not have authentication enabled.

### Changed
- Updated travis, goreleaser configurations.
- Updated license.
- If no endpoint addr is provided, the handler will default to http://localhost:8086/

### Removed
- Removed redundant post deploy scripts for travis.

## [3.1.1] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Adds .bonsai.yml.
- Use of envvar by default for sensitive InfluxDB credentials: addr,username, and password. This prevents leaking of sensitive credential into system process table via command argument. This is a backwards compatible change, commandline arguments can still be used to override envvar values. Here is the envvar to argument mapping:
    - INFLUXDB_ADDR => --addr 
    - INFLUXDB_USER => --username
    - INFLUXDB_PASS => --password

## [3.1.0] - 2018-12-14
### Added
- Adds `--precision` flag (still defaults to 's').
- Adds `--insecure-skip-verify` flag (still defaults to false).

## [3.0.2] - 2018-12-05
### Changed
- Travis post-deploy script generates a sha512 for packages to be sensu asset compatible.

## [3.0.1] - 2018-11-30
### Changed
- Updated the goreleaser file to include env and main in the same
build, hopefully stopping double builds.

## [3.0.0] - 2018-11-30
### Breaking Changes
- Updated sensu-go version to GA RC SHA.
- Updated the goreleaser file so that the handler is packaged as a Sensu
Go compatible asset.

## [v2.0] - 2018-11-21
### Breaking Changes
- Updated sensu-go version to beta-8 and fixed some breaking changes that
were introduced (`Entity.ID` -> `Entity.Name`).
- Changed tag `sensu_entity_id` to `sensu_entity_name` for consistency.

### Removed
- Removed the vendor directory. Dependencies are still managed with Gopkg.toml.

## [v1.8] - 2018-10-23
